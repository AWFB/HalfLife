# HalfLife

A tumour marker X is used to guide a decision on chemotherapy after the resection of
the main tumour mass. The concentration decays exponentially. If the half-life of the
tumour marker is less than 75 hours, then this is indicative of tumour clearance and
chemotherapy is withheld. If the half-life is greater than this, it indicates that residual
disease is present and chemotherapy is indicated. The precision of the assay is such that
measurements can be safely made at a precisely timed interval of more than 36 hours
from two or more days after surgery.

The level of X at 50 hours post surgery is 1756 ng/L and at 94 hours it is 1,050 ng/L.

Calculate the half-life and indicate whether you can say with confidence whether
chemotherapy needs to be given.
